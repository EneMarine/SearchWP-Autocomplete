# SearchWP-Autocomplete

**Be careful. At the moment this plugin only gets terms from the dabase wp_swp_terms. ACF Field are also shown.**
To enable add the class `class=".swp-autocomplete__search"` to your form and be sure that the input you want to be autocompleted has the id `id="s"`.

## Todo
- [ ] Index only fields and content specified in the engines
- [ ] Autoimplement autocomplete on the searchform.php
